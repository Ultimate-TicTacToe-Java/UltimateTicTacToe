# Game description

Ultimate tic tac toe, is an extension of the taxing game of tic tac toe. 
Rules:
- The game board consists of **9 game boards**
- Each game board has **9 tiles** for placing a symbol.
- Placing a token on the X (e.g. #4) requires the player to make the next move on the X (e.g. #4).
- Players put **circles** or **crosses** in the boxes until one of them wins or there is a draw on the board.
- The player who wins on a particular board **places his symbol there**. 
- Play continues until someone wins most of the boards, or there is a tie.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
# Installation

Since I had a lot of problems to fire it up in my configuration (WSL2 Ubuntu 20.04)
here is how I managed to fire the project in **JetBrains IntelliJ**

```sh
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jre-headless
```

```sh
sudo apt install libgtk-3-0
```

I also downloaded [JavaFX library](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/) version `openjfx-18.0.1_linux-x64_bin-jmods` (**JMODS** - this is very important, because we work with modular Java)
and put it in the `lib/` directory somewhere on my desktop.

Because of its size (about 100 MB) I did not put the library in the repository

### Open the project

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Ultimate-TicTacToe-Java/UltimateTicTacToe
```

Open **UltimateTicTacToe** in IntelliJ using `File` -> `Open`.

Add the configuration `Add configuration` -> `Application`.

- Choose `openjdk-18` as the environment.

- Select `Game` from the `Chose main class` field.

Close the configuration window. 3.

3. add the JavaFX library

`File` -> `Project Structure...` -> `Libraries` -> `+` -> `Java`

In the path field, paste

`<root path to project>/UltimateTicTacToe/lib/openjfx-18.0.1_linux-x64_bin-jmods/lib`

Build the project
